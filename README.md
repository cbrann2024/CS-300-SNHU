Herein lies the files as required of CS 300 ... from now until time immemorial to come.... 

These files are the result of late nights ... early mornings  ...  research and wild guesses   ....
I hope they help you find your way to what you are looking for. 

More to come ... 


Now to adress the assignemnt for Week 8 ... 

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

  I think in this couse we learned about a few different data structures, how they worked and were implemented in code, and what the different structures were most suited for. The problem we were actually solving was how to be able to store and retrieve data, in the most appropriate manner possible. In deciding what structure to implement we needed to understand how much data there was or was going to be, how frequently it would be updated, and what criteria was most important to the user. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

To understand which data structure to implement, I first had to understand and analyse the problem. By understaning the problem at hand, I could apply the most effective data strucutre that would hopefully meeth the needs of the user as best as possible. The different strucutres offered different advantages and disadvatages. A linked list is easy to implement, but can be come very time cinsuming when the data set gets large, or if a new data entry must be made somewhere in the list, instead of just adding it on the end. The hash table ws moderately complesx to implement, but gave much better results when storing and searching values from a file into a table. I would reccomend caution with a hash tabel implementation, if the hashing algorith is not well though out, it can place all the entries under one heading, therefore negating any speed improvmeents gained by the more complicated structure. and finally the binary tree was most complicated to inplement, but was most efficient when inserting as nnew value or searching for a specific entry, as the most number of entries searched would be at most half the entries. Even including the time used to implement the code a well designed binart search treee is an excellent solution to a particular problem.  

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

At the beginning and thoughout this course my unfamiliarity with the C++ language proved to be very challenging to me. I had to do a significant amount of research while coding to come out with code that worked and functioned as it should. That being said, by researching the code syntax the way I did, I beleice I have a better understanding as to how the code actually functions. And that understanding should in turn help me solve problems in the future when I write code that doesne't work or responds strangely, I'll have a better idea of how to fix it.  

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

By being exposed to a new section of syntax and seeing it working (after a while...) I am reinvigorated to continue on my journey to become a software engineer, and design nad write code to make stuff happen. I definitely undersand more about how code works in general and how to write it more effectively. To that end I am reinvigorating some old projects I was workng one in Dart/Flutter that I had to stop on, because my ideas and desires outstripped my ability at the time. I didn't even know the rigth questions to ask to solve the problems I had. Now I have a beeter idea of what to ask, and where to find resources to addrress any coding problems I might have.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Thourout the course my feedback from the insturctor has been consisitient: I demonstrate a high understnading and grasp of how to code, and how to write good solid code. But I need to leave more documentation behind abotu what it is supposed to do, and how it works... and possibly where some of the data comes from to make problems solving easier down the road. I am also inspried to try to write code that can be re used in the same program or in other progrmas, because the wheel is not going to get rounder, why re invent it?

So all thta being said, I hope this helps someone who needs it,
